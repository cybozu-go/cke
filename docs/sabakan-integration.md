Automatic cluster maintenance with sabakan
==========================================

[Sabakan][sabakan] is a network boot service.  It has a registry of machines in
a data center and keeps status information of machines.  It is convenient if CKE
can reference sabakan registry and generates Kubernetes cluster configuration
by itself.

In fact, CKE can be integrated with sabakan to achieve this.

How it works
------------

When enabled, CKE periodically query sabakan to retrieve available machines
in a data center and generates [cluster](cluster.md) configuration from a
user-supplied template.

Users can specify variables for the query to choose machines.  The query
will be executed by sabakan [GraphQL `searchMachines`](https://github.com/cybozu-go/sabakan/blob/master/docs/graphql.md) API.

Labels and other attributes of sabakan [`Machine`][schema] will be
translated into Kubernetes Node labels.

To keep Kubernetes and etcd cluster stable, CKE deliberately changes the
cluster configuration.  Details are described in the following sections.

Cluster template
----------------

Sabakan integration generates the cluster definition from a user-defined template.
The template syntax is the same as [cluster.yml](cluster.md).

The difference is that the template must have at least one control plane node
and one non-control plane node.

A minimal template looks like:

```yaml
name: cluster
nodes:
- user: cybozu
  control_plane: true
- user: cybozu
  control_plane: false
service_subnet: 10.68.0.0/16
```

When the configuration template is updated, CKE will soon regenerate
the cluster configuration from the new template.

Roles
-----------------

In general, servers in data centers can be classified into several types.
For example, _compute_ servers are typically used to run VM or container workloads
while _storage_ servers are used to store large persistent data.

Servers defined in sabakan have a mandatory attribute "role" for this classification.

To support a Kubernetes cluster consisting of multiple roles such as
"compute", "storage", and "gpu", sabakan integration of CKE allows users to
specify node templates for each server role in the cluster.

The node role is specified with `cke.cybozu.com/role` label value.

An example to specify the compute/storage/gpu  looks like:

```yaml
name: cluster
nodes:
- user: cybozu
  control_plane: true
  labels:
    # Use compute servers for control plane nodes
    cke.cybozu.com/role: "compute"
- user: cybozu
  labels:
    cke.cybozu.com/role: "compute"
- user: cybozu
  labels:
    cke.cybozu.com/role: "storage"
  taints:
  - key: cke.cybozu.com/role
    value: storage
    effect: NoExecute
- user: cybozu
  labels:
    cke.cybozu.com/role: "gpu"
  taints:
  - key: cke.cybozu.com/role
    value: gpu
    effect: PreferNoSchedule
service_subnet: 10.68.0.0/16
```

### Node template without role

If a node template lacks `cke.cybozu.com/role` label, any servers can match it.

If there are more than two templates for non-control plane nodes, they must have
`cke.cybozu.com/role` label.


Query and variables
-------------------

CKE uses the following GraphQL query to retrieve machine information from sabakan:

```
query ckeSearch($having: MachineParams = null,
                $notHaving: MachineParams = {
                  roles: ["boot"]
                  states: [RETIRED]
                }) {
  searchMachines(having: $having, notHaving: $notHaving) {
    # snip
  }
}
```

<a name="variables"></a>
Users may specify `$having` and `$notHaving` to change the search conditions.
They can be specified by a JSON object like this:

```json
{
  "having": {
    "labels": [{"name": "foo", "value": "bar"}],
    "roles": ["worker", "gpu"]
  },
  "notHaving": {
    "states": ["UNINITIALIZED", "RETIRED"]
  }
}
```

`$having` and `$notHaving` are `MachineParams`.  Consult [GraphQL schema][schema]
for the definition of `MachineParams`.

Strategy
--------

CKE generates cluster configuration with the following conditions.

*Musts*:

* User-specified [constraints](constraints.md) must be satisfied.
* etcd cluster must not be broken.
* Kubernetes cluster must not be broken.

*Shoulds*:

* If the template node for control plane has `cke.cybozu.com/role` label,
    servers of control plane nodes should be the specified role.
* Promote all healthy servers as kubernetes node.
* Unreachable machines in the cluster should be [tainted][taint] with `NoSchedule`.
* Retiring and retired machines should be [tainted][taint] with `NoExecute`.
* Retired machines should be removed if the machines are kept retired for a while.
* Rebooting machines should not be removed from the cluster nor be tainted.
* Each change of the cluster configuration should be made as small as possible.
* Control plane nodes should be distributed across different racks.
* All control plane nodes should be healthy.
* All control plane nodes should not be tainted.  The following taints are tolerated:
    * [Transitional taints added by the Kubernetes system][well-known taints] such as `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready`
    * Transitional taints added by CKE, i.e. `cke.cybozu.com/state`
    * Taints for control plane nodes added by CKE, i.e. `cke.cybozu.com/master`
    * User-tolerated taints specified in the [cluster template](#cluster-template)
    * A taint which specified in the `spare_node_taint_key` field in the [cluster template](cluster.md#spare_node_taint_key)

Algorithms
----------

### Node selection

Sabakan integration promotes all healthy machines as Kubernetes nodes.

The selection of control-plane is as follows:

1. Select unused healthy machines of preferred roles. If there are no
   such machines, select healthy machines of preferred roles from the existing workers.
2. Filter out machines which are tainted outside of the CKE.
3. If there are machines with a taint specified in `spare_node_taint_key`, prefer them.
4. Add the following score to each machine:
    - (100 - (machine counts which have the same role and in the same rack)) * 10
5. Add the following scores to each machine:
    - If the machine's lifetime is > 250 days, +1.
    - If the machine's lifetime is > 500 days, +1 (+2 in total).
    - If the machine's lifetime is > 1000 days, +1 (+3 in total).
    - If the machine's lifetime is < -250 days, -1.
    - If the machine's lifetime is < -500 days, -1 (-2 in total).
    - If the machine's lifetime is < -1000 days, -1 (-3 in total).
6. Select the highest scored machine.

When an existing control-plane need to be removed from the cluster configuration,
the algorithm select one as follows:

1. Add the following score to each machine:
    - If the machine's state is healthy, +1000.
2. Add the following score to each machine:
    - (100 - (machine counts which have the same role and in the same rack)) * 10
3. Add scores to each machine as follows:
    - If the machine's lifetime is > 250 days, +1.
    - If the machine's lifetime is > 500 days, +1 (+2 in total).
    - If the machine's lifetime is > 1000 days, +1 (+3 in total).
    - If the machine's lifetime is < -250 days, -1.
    - If the machine's lifetime is < -500 days, -1 (-2 in total).
    - If the machine's lifetime is < -1000 days, -1 (-3 in total).
4. Select the lowest scored machine.

### Initialization

The first time CKE generates cluster configuration from a template, it works
as follows:

1. Search sabakan to acquire the list of available machines.
2. Select `control-plane-count` nodes for Kubernetes/etcd control plane.
3. Select worker nodes.

The algorithm fails when available healthy nodes are not enough to
satisfy constraints.

### Spare node

By adding the taint specified by `spare_node_taint_key` to a node, you can indicate that the node is a spare node.
CKE gives priority to spare nodes when replacing a control-plane. Even if it becomes a control-plane, the taint is not removed by CKE, so it must be deleted manually if necessary.

### Maintenance

While CKE is idle, it queries sabakan periodically to check any updates on
the available machines.  The algorithm tries to minimize the change of the
cluster configuration.

First, CKE acquires _the list_ of available machines and its statuses from
sabakan then compares the list with _the current cluster_ configuration.

Then it selects one of the following actions if the condition matches.

#### Remove non-existent nodes

If the current cluster contains nodes that no longer exist in the list,
they are removed. This should be executed at the beginning because non-existent
nodes block CKE.

New nodes may be added to satisfy constraints.

If too many control plane nodes would be removed, this algorithm cannot
work because replacing more than half of etcd servers would break the
cluster.  In this case, administrators need to fix the cluster
configuration manually.

#### Increase control plane nodes

When `control-plane-count` constraint is increased, control plane nodes are
added.
A node which has a taint that is specified in the `spare_node_taint_key` becomes
a candidate for a control plane node.
If there are no such worker nodes, existing healthy-and-untainted worker nodes are *changed* to control plane
nodes.

#### Decrease control plane nodes

When `control-plane-count` constraint is decreased, control plane nodes are
*changed* to non-control-plane nodes.


#### Increase worker nodes

If there are healthy machines that are not used in the current cluster configuration, the machines are promoted to a worker node.

#### Decrease worker nodes

If a worker node is kept retired for a while,
it is removed from the cluster if the rate of healthy workers and available machines is greater than `minimum-workers-rate`.

#### Taint nodes

CKE adds  [taints][taint] to nodes as follows.
The taint key is `cke.cybozu.com/state`.

| Machine state | Taint value   | Taint effect |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Unreachable   | `unreachable` | `NoSchedule` |
| Retiring      | `retiring`    | `NoExecute`  |
| Retired       | `retired`     | `NoExecute`  |

For other machine states, the taint is removed.

Node labels
-----------

Sabakan [`Machine`][schema] `labels` are translated to Kubernetes Node labels.
The label key will be prefixed by `sabakan.cke.cybozu.com/`.

Other Machine fields are also translated to labels as follows.
`topology.kubernetes.io/zone` and `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone`(deprecated) are well-known labels.
`node-role.kubernetes.io/<role>` are used by `kubectl` to display the node's role.

| Field               | Label key                                | Value                                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `spec.rack`         | `cke.cybozu.com/rack`                    | `spec.rack` converted to string.                    |
| `spec.rack`         | `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`            | `spec.rack` converted to string with prefix `rack`. |
| `spec.rack`         | `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` | `spec.rack` converted to string with prefix `rack`. |
| `spec.indexInRack`  | `cke.cybozu.com/index-in-rack`           | `spec.indexInRack` converted to string.             |
| `spec.role`         | `cke.cybozu.com/role`                    | The same as `spec.role`.                            |
| `spec.role`         | `node-role.kubernetes.io/<role>`         | `"true"`                                            |
| `spec.registerDate` | `cke.cybozu.com/register-month`          | `spec.registerDate` in `yyyy-MM` format.            |
| `spec.retireDate`   | `cke.cybozu.com/retire-month`            | `spec.retireDate` in `yyyy-MM` format.              |

In addition `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` is set to `"true"` in the control plane node.

Node annotations
----------------

Following Machine fields are translated to Node annotations:

| Field               | Annotation key                 | Value                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `spec.serial`       | `cke.cybozu.com/serial`        | The same as `spec.serial`.             |
| `spec.registerDate` | `cke.cybozu.com/register-date` | `spec.registerDate` in RFC3339 format. |
| `spec.retireDate`   | `cke.cybozu.com/retire-date`   | `spec.retireDate` in RFC3339 format.   |
